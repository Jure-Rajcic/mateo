# TV TRAP Template 🚀

This template encapsulates my personal programming style and includes many features I commonly use. I’ve put it up as a template on my GitHub, so I don’t have to worry about setting up the same tech stack repeatedly for most of my projects. 

## Features 🌟

This project includes a robust selection of technologies and strategies:
- **(T) Tailwind CSS** 🎨: Assists in styling.
- **(V) Vue 3** 💡: Leverages the Composition API for a cleaner, boilerplate-free setup.
-  
- **(T) TypeScript** 📝: Provides better type checking.
- **(R) Router** 🧭: Handles routing.
- **(A) Axios** 🌐: Manages network calls.
- **(P) Pinia** 📦: For state management.

Vue is set up using the Composition API without boilerplate code, promoting a clean and minimalist approach. Here are some cool things you'll find in this template:

- Lazy loading and async component loading with skeleton loaders.
- Support for multiple layouts.
- Tailwind CSS configuration without the complexity of additional component libraries or styling "magic."
